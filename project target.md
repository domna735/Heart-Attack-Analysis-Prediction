Objectives:

§  Explore the power of data mining in solving a practical problem

§  Learn, formulate and develop an effective data mining solution

§  Practice your understanding of data mining techniques!

Brief Description

Based on a selected dataset, i.e., Heart Attack Analysis and Prediction (HAAP) Dataset (which can be downloaded from Kaggle), you work on your own to formulate, design and implement a data mining solution, evaluate its performance, possibly improve your method and report your findings and analysis. The marking criteria are as follows

§  Formulation, System Design and Implementation (40%)

§  Innovation and Improvement Made (30%)

§  Report, Analysis and Presentation (30%)

What to hand in: (Please refer to the submission page later!)

§  Your codes or the way you come with your final implementation (e.g. what public codes/tools your team used)

§  A final report (e.g. roughly 10 pages) summarizing the work (particularly, formulation, analysis, and evaluation) you has done.

§  A video presentation of your achievement:

o   Please try your best to limit your video file size to 300MB and length <=5 minutes.

 About Dataset
The Heart Attack Analysis & Prediction Dataset is a dataset used for research and analysis in the field of cardiovascular health. It typically contains various attributes related to an individual's health and lifestyle, along with an indicator of whether the individual experienced a heart attack or not.

Here are some common attributes found in such datasets:

Age: The age of the individual.
**Sex: **The gender of the individual.
Chest Pain Type: The type of chest pain experienced by the individual.
Resting Blood Pressure: The resting blood pressure of the individual (in mm Hg).
**Cholesterol: **The cholesterol levels of the individual (in mg/dL).
**Fasting Blood Sugar: **The fasting blood sugar level of the individual (> 120 mg/dL is considered high).
**Resting Electrocardiographic Results (ECG): **Results of the resting electrocardiogram.
Maximum Heart Rate Achieved: The maximum heart rate achieved by the individual during exercise.
**Exercise Induced Angina: **Whether the individual experienced angina during exercise.
**ST Depression Induced by Exercise: **The ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest.
**Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment: **The slope of the peak exercise ST segment.
**Number of Major Vessels Colored by Fluoroscopy: **The number of major blood vessels colored by fluoroscopy.
**Thalassemia: **A blood disorder; different types of thalassemia might be represented in the dataset.
**Target: **Whether the individual had a heart attack or not (typically represented as binary: 0 for no heart attack, 1 for heart attack).

This dataset is often used for building machine learning models to predict the likelihood of a person having a heart attack based on their health attributes. Researchers and healthcare professionals use such models to better understand risk factors and develop preventive strategies for cardiovascular diseases.
